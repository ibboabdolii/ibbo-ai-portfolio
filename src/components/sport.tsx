          My name is Ibbo Abdoli. Before building my professional career in
          industrial automation and engineering, sports played a defining role
          in my life. I competed at a high level in mountain bike racing and took
          part in demanding international competitions.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-3 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          This athletic background taught me discipline, mental focus, and how
          to perform under pressure. Consistent training and competition shaped
          my ability to stay calm, pay attention to detail, and remain committed
          until the task is completed.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-3 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Today, I bring the same mindset into my work as a Service Engineer and
          Automation Technician. Whether I am troubleshooting industrial
          systems, working with production lines, or solving complex technical
          problems, the discipline I developed through sports continues to guide
          the way I work.
