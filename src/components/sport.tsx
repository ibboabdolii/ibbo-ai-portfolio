          Staying physically active is an important part of how I maintain focus,
          energy, and mental balance alongside my technical work. I currently train
          regularly at <strong>Actic Gym</strong>, and I also spend time on
          <strong> walking</strong> and <strong>swimming</strong> as part of my routine.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
          These activities help me manage stress, stay disciplined, and keep a clear
          mindset. Maintaining good physical condition directly supports my ability
          to stay calm, precise, and structured when working in demanding technical
          environments.

        <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
          As a <strong>Service Engineer and Automation Technician</strong>, this balance
          plays a key role in how I approach troubleshooting, on-site work, and complex
          problem-solving. The discipline I build through regular training reflects
          directly in my professional performance.
