  Sports & Discipline
</h2>

<p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
  My name is Ibbo Abdoli. One of the most demanding and formative experiences
  in my life was competing at a high level in mountain bike racing across
  Europe. Standing on international start lines required complete focus,
  physical endurance, and mental control.

<p className="mt-3 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
  Training and racing under pressure taught me discipline, stress management,
  and the ability to make fast, precise decisions when it matters most.
  You learn quickly that losing focus for even a moment can have real
  consequences.

<p className="mt-3 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
  Today, I bring the same mindset into my work as a Service Engineer and
  Automation Technician. Whether I am troubleshooting industrial systems,
  working with production lines, or handling critical on-site situations,
  I stay calm, structured, and solution-focused — exactly as I did in
  competition.
</p>

<p className="mt-3 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
  Outside of work, I still enjoy staying active, traveling, and cooking with
  friends. Sports remain an important part of how I maintain balance,
  energy, and long-term performance.
